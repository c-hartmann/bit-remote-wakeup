# bit-remote-wakeup

A so called 'User Callback Script' for 'Back In Time'.

## Warning

Status is WIP and WFM only!

## Install

Copy file either as ```user-callback``` into folder:

```
$HOME/.config/backintime/
```

or as ```user-callback.remote_wakeup``` into:

```
$HOME/.config/backintime/user-callback.d/
```

if you are using the ```user-callback.multiple-scripts``` script.

## Note

Back In Time calls one script only:

```
$HOME/.config/backintime/user-callback
```

You have to either rename any script or link to it.
